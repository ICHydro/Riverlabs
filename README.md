# Riverlabs

This is the code repository for the [Riverlabs](https://riverlabs.uk) suite of sensors.

The Riverlabs sensors use the Arduino bootloader, and the recommended programming environment is therefore the Arduino IDE. To get started with Arduino, we refer to the excellent [Arduino documentation](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).

For specific instructions on each sensor, look in the respective sensor folder.

Our code is based on numerous libraries, examples, and discussion posts from the Arduino community. We do our best to acknowledge and reference all sources of external code and specific solutions. For any improvements, corrections, and other comments, do not hesitate to [get in touch](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.buytaert).
