The Riverlabs loggers are based on the Arduino bootloader. This means that they can be programmed easily using the USB port of a PC. It also means that a very large range of tools and documentation is available as part of the Arduino open hardware ecosystem. 




Riverlabs produces two loggers. The Wari model is based on a Maxbotix ultrasound rangefinder, and the WMOnode model is based on a Garmin Lidarlite v3HP lidar distance sensor. They have the following technical specifications:
