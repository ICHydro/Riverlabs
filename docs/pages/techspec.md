## Wari logger

### Overview

The Wari logger is based around the Maxbotix MB7389 Ultrasound distance sensor. Due to the short range of ultrasound sensors (5&nbsp;m in the case of the MB7389) ultrasound loggers are mostly suitable for water level sensing in small rivers and reservoirs. The Wari does not have telemetry functionality, and is therefore only suited for offline data collection with local storage onto an SD card. It is engineered for ultra low power consumption, with a battery life of over 5 years under typical use.


The Wari has the following characteristics:

### Technical specifications

| Range                      | 300 mm - 5000 mm |
| Resolution (water level)   | 1 mm             |
| Resolution (temperature)   | 0.25°C           |
| Resolution (voltage)       | 0.01 V           |
| Accuracy (water level)     | ~ 5 mm           |

| Water resistance           | IP67             |


## WMOnode

### Overview

The WMOnode was developed as part of the WMO funded Innovation Hub project. It is based around a Lidarlite v3HP lidar distance sensor with a range of up to 35 m, and has a slot for a telemetry module (XBee form factor). We typically combine it with a DIGI 3G Cellular modem for telemetry.

### Technical specifications

| Resolution (water level)   | 1 cm             |
| Resolution (temperature)   | 0.25°C           |
| Resolution (voltage)       | 0.01 V           |
| Accuracy (water level)     | ~ 5 - 10 cm      |
| Power supply               | 1 x 3.6 V Li-ion battery (18650) |
| Water resistance           | IP67             |
